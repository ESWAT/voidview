# 👁 VoidView

> Stare into image collection

VoidView is an Electron-based minimalist image viewer (only for macOS at the moment). I created it as an alternative to Adobe Bridge that made viewing imagery in a single directory the main focus, rather than obtaining metadata, interfacing with other software or being distracted by a lot of UI chrome.
