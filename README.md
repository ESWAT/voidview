> Step into the void, surrounded by imagery and inspiration

[VoidView](https://eswat.ca/voidview/) is an Electron-based minimalist image viewer. An alternative to Adobe Bridge, it was made for viewing imagery from a single directory or multiple files to quickly seek inspiration, rather than obtaining metadata, interfacing with other software or being distracted by a lot of UI chrome.

## Features

- Quick and simple navigation with mouse or keyboard (with Vim-inspired shortcuts)
- 99% of UI real estate devoted to display of imagery
- Useful Help modal shows all you need to use VoidView without getting in the way of your imagery
- Can display single images in either their original resolution or expanded to fit the viewport
- Useful options like *Always On Top* and *Fit Frame to Image* make VoidView a great alternative to reference image applications like PureRef
